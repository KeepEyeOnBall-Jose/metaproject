Autolinker TDL


- Separate the repo out of BRICKS, currently in separate branch with (a priori no overlap)
- Review ports if the project is deployed with docker, make sure there's no overlap and that both the "native" and the dockerized versions of the project work exactly the same way, but just listening in different ports. TOPIC: what about data access?
- Complete a clear PRD for each of the projects. HIGHEST LEVERAGE!
