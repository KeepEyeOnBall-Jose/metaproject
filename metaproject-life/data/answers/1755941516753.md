Private answer: ETL vs ELT workflows — concise explanation and examples

(Stored privately; not shown here.)

Short explanation:
- ETL (Extract, Transform, Load): data is extracted from sources, transformed (cleaned/enriched) in a processing layer, and then loaded into a data warehouse. Good when the warehouse is optimized for analytics and you want curated data.
- ELT (Extract, Load, Transform): data is extracted and loaded into a data lake/warehouse first, then transformed inside the destination (often using scalable compute). Good for large volumes and flexible schema.

Common components:
- Extract: connectors to DBs, APIs, files
- Transform: data cleaning, joins, aggregations, schema mapping (can be batch or streaming)
- Load: write to destination (warehouse, lake)

Examples:
- ETL: Airbyte extract -> dbt transforms -> load into Snowflake
- ELT: Extract to S3 then use Snowflake or BigQuery to transform with SQL

Next steps: I can expand with tooling recommendations, architecture diagrams, or a short tutorial tied to your stack.
