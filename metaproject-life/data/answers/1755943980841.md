Private answer: Deployment details for backend and motherboard services

(Stored privately; not shown here.)

Summary:
- Typical patterns: container images (Docker) built in CI, pushed to registry, deployed to Kubernetes with Helm/kustomize, or deployed to PaaS (Render, Fly, Heroku).
- Configs to look for: Dockerfile, helm charts, k8s manifests, GitHub Actions / CI pipelines, Terraform for infra, systemd or service configs for VMs.
- Motherboard services specifics: which repo contains them (keob-nodes?), systemd vs k8s, any rolling update strategy.

I can inspect `linked_projects/backend` and `linked_projects/keob-nodes` to find the exact pipeline.
