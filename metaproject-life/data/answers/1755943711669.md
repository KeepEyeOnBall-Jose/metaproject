Private answer: Reverse proxy definition and typical deployment (aspire project specifics)

(Stored privately; not shown here.)

Contents:
- What a reverse proxy is: HTTP layer routing, TLS termination, caching, load balancing, request routing, header manipulation.
- Typical deployment options: Nginx, HAProxy, Traefik, Envoy; container vs host; configuration examples.
- Aspire-specific notes: where to find ingress configs (k8s ingress/nginx), Docker compose proxies, and sample Nginx conf.

I can inspect the `backend`/`aspire` repo and locate the exact reverse proxy config (nginx conf, ingress). Tell me if you want me to search for `nginx.conf`, `traefik`, `ingress`, `Dockerfile` in the linked projects.
