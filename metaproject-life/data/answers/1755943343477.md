Private answer: Puppeteer vs Playwright — drivers, browsers, headless, anti-bot, and best practices

(Stored privately; not shown here.)

Summary:
- Puppeteer: originally Google project; simplified API for controlling Chromium/Blink browsers. Puppeteer primarily targets Chromium (Chrome/Edge).
- Playwright: Microsoft project; supports Chromium, WebKit, and Firefox with a single API; stronger cross-browser testing.

Drivers & runtimes:
- Both ship and install browser binaries automatically (or can connect to system-installed browsers).
- They use DevTools Protocol (Chromium) or CDP-like protocols; Playwright includes its own driver layers for other engines.

Headless vs headed:
- Headless runs without UI; faster but may behave slightly differently. Modern browsers support headful with no display via xvfb/headless on CI.

Anti-bot and impersonation:
- Sites may detect automated browsers via navigator.webdriver, missing fonts, certain headers, timing, or mouse/scroll patterns.
- Mitigations: enable non-headless mode, set proper user-agent, emulate viewport/screen, add realistic input events (mouse movement, delays), use real browser profiles, load fonts, use stealth plugins (e.g., puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth), and proxy/IP rotation for scale.
- Respect terms: for your own sites use testing environments or consent.

Best practices:
- Use Playwright for multi-browser testing; Puppeteer for Chromium-focused workflows.
- Use selectors robustly (data-* attributes) and avoid brittle selectors.
- Run tests in CI with observed retries and screenshots on failure.
- Isolate test data and reset state between runs.

If you want, I can:
- Add Playwright or Puppeteer to `Altamira` project, with a simple test script and CI job, or
- Generate a sample test that clicks through a specific page; provide the URL and target flow.
