Private answer: How to count references of a method or module

(Stored privately; not shown here.)

Quick methods:
- Use language-aware tools (IDE features): VS Code "Find All References", Pyright/Language Server reference search, IntelliJ/GoLand. These use AST and symbol tables.
- ctags/gtags: build tags and query symbol references across files.
- grep/ag/rg: approximate textual search for symbol names, beware false positives/negatives.
- Static analysis tools: Pyright, ruff (for Python), tsserver for TypeScript, go tool for Go; they provide cross-file symbol reference counts.
- Code indexing: Sourcegraph, OpenGrok, or local ripgrep indexers can show references across repos.

Practical steps:
1. Ensure workspace includes the project root and has language server configured.
2. Run IDE "Find All References" or language server query on the symbol.
3. For batch counts, use LSP-based tools or ask `rg -n "\bMyMethod\b"` and then filter out definitions.

Next: I can run a quick symbol search in any linked project if you tell me which file and symbol to check.
