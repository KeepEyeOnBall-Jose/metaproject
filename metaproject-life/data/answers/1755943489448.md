Private answer: Pylint vs Flake8 vs mypy vs ruff vs Black

(Stored privately; not shown here.)

Summary (concise):
- Pylint: heavyweight linter and static checker; enforces coding standards, detects many code smells, provides scores and configurable rule sets.
- Flake8: pluggable linter focusing on style and errors; commonly used with plugins for complexity and docstring checks.
- mypy: static type checker; checks type hints and ensures type correctness.
- ruff: fast, all-in-one linter/formatter replacement written in Rust; can replace Flake8 and many plugins; very fast.
- Black: opinionated code formatter; enforces consistent formatting, not a linter per se.

Typical responsibilities:
- Formatting: Black (auto-format)
- Type checking: mypy
- Linting/style: ruff/Flake8/Pylint (ruff is fastest)
- Use mix: Black for formatting, mypy for types, ruff for linting and fixes; Pylint for deep code quality checks if desired.

Next: I can configure a minimal `pyproject.toml` with recommended settings for your workspace and wire them into CI; shall I add it to the repo?
