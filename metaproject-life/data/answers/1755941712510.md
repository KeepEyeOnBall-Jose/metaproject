Private answer: What is a VS Code workspace and how Copilot relates to it

(Stored privately; not shown here.)

Short definition:
- VS Code folder: a single directory opened in the editor. Minimal context, no saved workspace settings.
- VS Code workspace: can be a single-folder workspace or a multi-root workspace (a .code-workspace file). A workspace stores window state, opened folders, and workspace-specific settings, extensions recommendations, and tasks.
- VS Code Copilot: an extension that uses workspace context (open files, project files) and optionally a repository to provide completions. Copilot can also use a special `github.copilot` configuration and may honor workspace-level settings and secrets.

Differences vs a solution in Visual Studio:
- VS solution (.sln) groups projects for compilation and debugging with MSBuild; VS Code workspace is editor-focused, flexible, and not tied to a single build system.

If you want, I can expand this into examples showing `.code-workspace` content and recommended workspace settings for Copilot.
