Private answer: How Copilot Chat windows map to terminals

(Stored privately; not shown here.)

Short answer:
- Each Copilot Chat window in VS Code can be associated with a workspace context (open folders/files). Terminals in VS Code are global to the window, not per chat pane. However, some Copilot / assistant integrations may create or use dedicated terminals for running commands; mapping depends on the extension implementation.
- If you open multiple windows (separate VS Code application windows), each window has its own set of terminals. Chat panes inside the same window share the same terminal pool unless the extension explicitly targets a terminal.

Details:
- Terminal read/write: VS Code terminals are addressable by name/index; extensions can create a terminal and send commands to it. Copilot Chat may create terminals per conversation if designed to do so; otherwise you need to inspect the chat settings.
- Configuration: check the extension settings for Copilot Chat (or the assistant you're using) to see if it has options like "create terminal per conversation" or "attach to active terminal".

Next: I can inspect the installed Copilot Chat extension settings in this workspace if you want; tell me whether to check extension config or list open terminals.
