Private answer: Research plan to determine if Merlin Properties is still using keepeyeonball.com and how to win them back

(Stored privately; not shown here.)

Initial research steps:
1. Check server logs and analytics for keepeyeonball.com for recent activity and referral/source.
2. Query DNS and hosting to see current owner and last deployment.
3. Search for mentions: LinkedIn, company site, press releases, job listings that mention tours or the product.
4. Review past contract or account data: last invoice, contact person, decision-maker.
5. Prepare outreach plan: targeted value proposition, demo, incentives, success metrics.

If you want, I can run public web/WHOIS checks and draft an outreach email; tell me what access I have (analytics, CRM, contract docs).
