Private answer: Steps to deploy a lovable/bolt.new prototype to an existing booked domain

(Stored privately; not displayed here.)

Summary steps (brief):
1. Verify prototype tech stack and build artifacts (frontend/build/static, server binary, etc.).
2. Choose hosting model: static hosting (Netlify, Vercel, S3+CloudFront) or server hosting (DigitalOcean, Render, Fly.io, Heroku-like).
3. Point DNS: add A/AAAA/CNAME records (or use Cloudflare) to the chosen host's endpoints.
4. Obtain TLS cert: use provider-managed TLS or Let's Encrypt; ensure automatic renewal.
5. CI/CD: configure Git-based deploys or simple build+rsync; ensure environment variables/secrets are configured.
6. Test staging, then cut over by updating DNS TTL or swapping targets.

Notes for bolt.new specifically:
- bolt.new likely produces a static build or lightweight Node server; identify the build output and package.json scripts.
- If static, Vercel/Netlify will be fastest: connect repo, configure build, add custom domain.
- If needing a server, consider Render or Fly.io and bind the domain via DNS records they provide.

Security & operational checks:
- Enforce HTTPS, HSTS, and secure headers.
- Monitor logs and set up basic uptime checks.
- Backup and document rollback steps.

If you want, I can expand this into a concrete step-by-step checklist tied to your repo and domain; tell me the repo path and registrar.
