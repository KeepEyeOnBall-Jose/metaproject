Private answer: APR explanation

(Stored privately; not shown here.)

APR can mean different things depending on context. Likely tech meanings:
- Apache Portable Runtime (APR) used by Apache HTTP Server for cross-platform APIs.
- APR as Annual Percentage Rate in finance (ignore if not relevant).
- If you meant another APR in your projects, tell me the context and I'll find it.

I can scan the linked projects for `APR` occurrences if you want.
