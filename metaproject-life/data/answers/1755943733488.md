Private answer: How to lock all dependencies for a repo

(Stored privately; not shown here.)

For Python:
- Use `pip freeze > requirements.txt` for simple projects.
- Use `pip-tools` (pip-compile / pip-sync) to lock transitive deps.
- Use `poetry lock` or `pipenv lock` if using those tools.
- Use lock files in CI and pin versions in `pyproject.toml`.

For Node.js:
- Use `npm ci` with `package-lock.json` or `pnpm-lock.yaml`.

For system-level: use distro package manager lock or container images.

I can generate a `requirements.txt` or `poetry.lock` for a selected project if you point me to it.
