Private answer: How to let the assistant access multiple projects/workspaces from one place

(Stored privately; not shown here.)

Options:
1. Multi-root workspace (.code-workspace): add several folders to one workspace so the assistant (and VS Code) can access them together.
2. Symlink or mount: create a folder that links to other project folders and open that central folder.
3. Repo aggregator: create a super-repo with submodules or a manifest that lists projects; open that.
4. Provide index/manifest file in this workspace that lists absolute/local paths to other projects; the assistant can read that file to locate projects.
5. Grant access explicitly: share paths or copy necessary files into a `linked_projects/` folder.

Next steps I can perform:
- Generate a `.code-workspace` file listing selected project folders.
- Create an index file `projects.json` with paths and short descriptions so I can scan them quickly.
- Draft a secure workflow for granting read-only access (e.g., point to local paths, avoid secrets).

Tell me which option you prefer and I will implement it here (create workspace file or index).
