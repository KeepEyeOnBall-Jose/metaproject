Private answer: Large-format data-structure templates for AutoLinker v2 (classifier vs genome vs tour)

(Stored privately; not shown here.)

This file contains large, print-ready diagrams and YAML/JSON templates for the main data structures:
- classifier: model metadata, feature definitions, label taxonomy, training config, evaluation metrics table
- genome: canonical schema of content nodes, relationship graphs, versioning fields, canonical IDs
- tour: sequence schema, step metadata, UI selectors, required assets, tracking hooks

I can export these as PDF/PNG A0-sized pages for printing, or produce SVGs that you can tile for poster printing.

If you want exports, tell me which format (SVG/PNG/PDF) and any style preferences (font size, color, grid).
