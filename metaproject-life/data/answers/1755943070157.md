Private answer: Multiple agent windows and terminal I/O configuration

(Stored privately; not shown here.)

Summary:
- Terminal scope: terminals are per VS Code window. Multiple chat/assistant panels within the same window share the terminal environment unless the extension isolates them.
- Read vs write: extensions must request access to write to terminals; chat windows typically use the active terminal or create their own.
- Configure: you can set up named terminals and instruct the extension (if supported) to use a named terminal. Otherwise, create dedicated VS Code windows per agent if isolation is needed.

Practical steps:
1. Create named terminals (Terminal -> New Terminal, then rename) and check extension docs for terminal targeting settings.
2. Use separate VS Code windows for strict separation.
3. Inspect the extension's commands or settings to see if it exposes an option to pick a terminal per conversation.

If you want, I can: list current terminals, inspect installed extension settings, or open Copilot Chat's config UI (read-only) to find terminal-related options.
