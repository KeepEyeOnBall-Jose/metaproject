Private answer: Perplexity metric vs Perplexity company/product

(Stored privately; not shown here.)

Perplexity (metric):
- In language modeling, perplexity measures how well a probability model predicts a sample. Lower perplexity means better predictive performance; it's exponential of cross-entropy.

Perplexity (company/product):
- Perplexity AI is a company offering an AI-powered Q&A/chat product; their product uses LLMs and search/aggregation to answer queries and may sell enterprise features. It's separate from the metric.

I can expand either explanation and gather public info about the company if needed.
