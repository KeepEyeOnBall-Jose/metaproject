Summary

There is a pending transfer of 3% equity (origin: KeepEyeOnBall era) intended for "Menorca Millennials". The task: reconcile and move this commitment into the new venture's cap table and legal structure.

Why

- Ensure clean cap table and legal compliance for the new venture.

Constraints & cautions

- Equity transfers have tax and legal implications; consult counsel before executing.
- Verify original transfer terms (vesting, restrictions, recipients) in historical agreements.
- Avoid unilateral changes without signed consent from required parties.

Actionable checklist

- Locate original agreement
  - Find the contract/email/board minute recording the 3% commitment. Note date, signatories, and any vesting or cliff.

- Validate current ownership and capacity to transfer
  - Confirm current cap table and whether the 3% is already issued, reserved, or merely promised.
  - Confirm whether the new venture (entity) accepts incoming equity or requires fresh issuance.

- Legal & tax consultation
  - Schedule a brief consult with corporate counsel (or an experienced startup attorney) to draft transfer/assignment documents and to clarify tax consequences.

- Draft transfer documents
  - Prepare an assignment agreement or amendment that references the original commitment and specifies the new entity and terms.
  - Include any necessary board/resolution approvals.

- Execute and record
  - Obtain signatures, update the cap table, file any necessary paperwork, and notify stakeholders.

- Follow-ups
  - Update stakeholder communications and internal records.
  - Add a reminder to review the tax treatment during the next accounting close.

Notes

- If the original commitment included vesting, preserve vesting schedule or formally re-negotiate with beneficiary.
- Keep copies of all communications and approvals.
