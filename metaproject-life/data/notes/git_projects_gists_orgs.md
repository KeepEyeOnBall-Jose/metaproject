Learning goal

Understand the differences, use cases, and best practices for Git projects, GitHub gists, and GitHub organizations. Get clarity on when to use each and how they relate to personal/team workflows.

Key questions to explore

- Git projects vs repositories: what's the difference and when to use project boards?
- GitHub gists: when to use gists vs repositories? Public vs secret gists? Can gists be collaborative?
- GitHub organizations: personal account vs organization account? When to create an org? How do permissions and billing work?
- Integration: how do projects, gists, and orgs work together in a typical development workflow?

Specific areas to dig into

- Project management: GitHub Projects (classic vs new), issue tracking, automation
- Gist workflows: code snippets, documentation, sharing configs, embedding in docs
- Organization structure: teams, repositories, access control, enterprise features
- Git hosting alternatives: GitLab, Bitbucket - how do their equivalents compare?

Next actions to consider

- Create a small test organization and explore the interface
- Try creating different types of gists (code snippets, configs, documentation)
- Set up a project board and link it to issues/PRs
- Compare GitHub vs GitLab organization features
