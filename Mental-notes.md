- I do NOT know enough about the evolutionary algorithm in the evo-alg in the autolinker project.
- I would like to be able to see (to better understand):
-   A visualization of the image's chromosomes
-   A visualization of the images classifiers' chromosomes and an envolutionary (evolving, live) view of the process; including the values of each of the hyper parameters
-   The clustering of the images according to their genomes
-   

A next order optimitation of the evolutionary algo that takes into account how long it takes to compute each gene, vs. how much weight the classifieres give them.
